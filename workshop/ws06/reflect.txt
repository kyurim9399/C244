In this assignment, I used the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
At first I didn't understand the difference between the two.
One of the differences between the two was whether the current object exists or is newly created.
The copy constructor creates a new object by copying an existing object.
The copy assignment operator copies an existing object to another object that already exists.
Because of this difference, when defining the copy assignment operator,
a delete statement was needed to deallocate the dynamic memory currently allocated to the object.

Another difference is that the copy assignment operator first checks 
whether the address of the current object and the source object are the same or not.
If this process is not performed, copying will not occur
because the delete statement can deallocate the dynamic memory of the source object.

And the two special member functions have similar codes, 
so I can make the code simpler by calling the copy assignment into the copy constructor.
In this case, the nullptr must be set first for variables that use dynamic memory 
to prevent deallocate of the dynamic memory in the copy adjustment operator function.

The other thing I learned was that the source object coming into the parameter was already validated because it already existed.
So we didn't have to validate the copy constructor (or assignment operator) when we defined it.

Finally, there was a need to define a function using the << operator, but at first I didn't know why.
However, when I looked at 'BasketTester.cpp', I found that it was for displaying data by simply entering code like 'cout << class name'.
