In this workshop, I learned how to split modules properly.
Remembering what I learned at ipc, I did this workshop.
I declared a function prototype in the header file.
In the implementation file, I declared the function definition 
and separated the code by storing the contents in the wordstat file as shown in pdf.
I also learned better how namespaces are used.
