 1. Dynamic memory is memory that is allocated memory space at execution stage. 
It also stores the address of each area in a pointer variable to allocate memory. 
So we can always allocate as much memory as we want.
However, the release of the space that is no longer used must be done manually by the user using delete.

  2. An error occurred when allocating dynamic memory and receiving the string entered by the user.
This is probably because I wrote the wrong address.
Use pointers to allocate dynamic memory
And I have to deallocation the memory I use.
Finally, we need to reinitialize the pointer to nullptr.

  3. The four overloaded functions gifting(char* description), gifting(double& price), gifting 
(int& units) gifting(Gift& gift) are differentiated by their unique parameters.

4. It was very difficult to directly allocate and free dynamic memory, but it was a good practice for me.
Also how to use #ifndef/#define properly so that same header files are not compiled twice.
