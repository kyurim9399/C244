Through the assignment, I learned more about the use of constructors and destructors.
To avoid undefined behaviour or corrupted objects we must initialize the object empty.
If we don't initialize, an error can occur because an undefined value is stored before setting the data.
Therefore, the constructor is necessary for complete encapsulation.
But when I studied with theory, I couldn't understand why a destructor is  necessary.
In this assignment, there was a situation where the defined char array m_name in the class had to be changed to setting m_name to pointer and allocate dynamic memory.
When I defined the destructor, I had to write the code to deallocate dynamic memory rather than leave it empty.
In addition, the destructor then deletes the object based on the construction order, not the order of use.
Also, when you try to access the data member of another object in a member function,
I learned that other.data can be accessed this way.
