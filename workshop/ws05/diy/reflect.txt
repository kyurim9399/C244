1. 
The most difficult part of this assignment was the useage of operator assignment.
When I add another object of Engine in the engine array,
(where I had to add it using the + = operator)
Considering the length increase, it was difficult to write code.
It was also really difficult to dynamically create a new array in this function,
copy existing array ​​to add new array, and copy new arrays to existing arrays.
Nevertheless, I was able to use it in the main to make it simpler 
to express the addition of an object using the member operator.

2. Creating a bool operator using == and < was not very difficult.
However, I knew that I could use operators like == or < for the 'bool operator', 
and it was also an opportunity to know how I used it by analyzing at shipmain.cpp.

3. 
When creating the calculatePower function, I declared 'size' as double in 'engine.h', 
I missed casting it to a float in the calculation process.

4. Finally, I didn't need to use destructor in lab, 
In 'diy', we had to deallocate dynamic memory using the destructor 
while dynamically allocating memory to the engine and ship. 
But I almost skipped this part.
