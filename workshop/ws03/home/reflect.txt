1. We must consider that the information coming from the client code is always valid.
If the input data is not valid, we can ignore the data and save the default value that identifies the state of the object as empty.
It is much more appropriate and meaningful to set a default than to specify no value or assign an invalid value.
Knowing that it's an empty state is useful because we know we can enter information into the object.
For example, suppose we have a data member named age in a class called student.
If the data entered is non-ageable (zero or negative) we can set the default value to zero.

2.The struct is basically a public data member.
In contrast, classes are private to data members by default.
Clients can only access public data members, not private data members.
To solve this, we can indirectly access the data member using the public member function of object.


3. If the programmer has coded using data that he wants to keep the value from changing,
 this is to prevent the client from accidentally changing the value of the data.
If we publish all the data, the client can manipulate or corrupt the data in an inappropriate way.
Therefore, clients should only be able to access published members.

4. I learned how to access a plivated data member using the member functions exposed in the class.
I learned how to write code to enter the appropriate data.
I learned how to output the decimal point to the desired place.
